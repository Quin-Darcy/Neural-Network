# Neural Network
---
### Summary
This program uses a simple feed-forward ANN with mini-batch gradient descent to generate a vector field, where each vector is predicted based of an $(x, y)$ input. The NN is trained on a randomly generated vector field where in data points are $(x, y)$ pairs, and the labels are 1 of `NUM_OF_DIRECTIONS` which denotes the approximate direction the vector is pointing.
